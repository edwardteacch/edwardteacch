      <h2>What is Gender Pay Gap?</h2>

     <p class="Paratext"style="position:absolute;top:950px;left:500px">Since the second half of the 20th century, women’s labor force participation has grown significantly.
      Women are working longer hours and pursuing higher education in greater numbers. 
      However, despite this progress, significant wage gaps between men and women persist—particularly for women of color. 
      So what exactly is the gender wage gap? What drives it?</p>
      <p class="Paratext"style="position:absolute;top:1050px;left:500px">The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration 
        for men and women who are working.</p>
      <p class="Paratext"style="position:absolute;top:1100px;left:500px">Women are generally found to be paid less than men. 
        There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus adjusted pay gap. 
        The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience.</p>
      <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;top:1200px;left:500px">The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently ranked India at 127 out of 146 countries in gender gap 
        Index and 6th in southern Asia.</p>

    <p class="Paratext"style="position:absolute;padding-left: 480px;top:1710px">The labour force participation rate is the number of persons in the labour force as a percentage of the working-age population. 
      The labour force is the sum of the number of persons employed and the number of persons unemployed.
      The indicator is also useful for understanding the labour market behaviour of different segments of the population. The level and pattern of labour force 
      participation depends on employment opportunities and the demand for income, which may differ from one category of persons to another. For example, studies have 
      shown that the labour force participation rates of women vary systematically, at any given age, with their marital status and level of education. 
      There are also important differences 
      in the participation rates of the urban and rural populations, and among different socio-economic groups.</p>
      <p class="Paratextlarge" style="position:absolute;font-size:24px;top:1945px;padding-left: 480px;">In India, the labor force participation rate among females is 24% 
        and among males is 73.6% for 2022</p>
      <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;top: 1980px;padding-left: 480px"> 
        Since 1990, female labor force participation has decreased.</p>
      <p  class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;top:2000px;padding-left: 480px"> Compared with labor force participation in the lower-middle income group, the gap between men and women is higher in India.</p>
     <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;top:2050px;padding-left: 480px"> India has seen a steady growth of labor force partcipation starting from the years 1991 to 2010 and then a gradual fall in the 
      work force participation.The labor force participation for women grew from 23 percent to 25 percent in 1991 to 2010, 
      and saw a shart fall to 21 percent in 2017.</p>

              While this is important for the health of the baby and the mother, prolonged maternity leave
            keeps women away from the employment scene for a long time, thus making us ask the question: Are child rearing responisibilities only

            <h3>Working hours</h3> 
            <p>the ILO highlights that women work on a part-time basis more than men do in all but five of
              the 73 countries where data are available.3 This is often linked to women taking on more of the unpaid
              family responsibilities. On the one hand, women may be in part-time employment as a result of
              the lack of affordable and sufficient child care. On the
              other hand, womens opportunities for full-time employment
              may be more limited than mens, resulting in
              women taking part-time employment. Part-time work
              does not always provide benefits that are proportional
              to those of full-time work, which can affect the remuneration
              package over time.</p>

              positions, especially at higher levels. When women are

    <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;left:500px;top: 3100px ">The burden of unpaid work falls disproportionately on women in India because tasks such as cooking, cleaning, fetching water and firewood are highly gendered, 
      and patriarchal norms dictate that women also perform care work, validate men’s failure to assume domestic responsibilities and thus entrench women’s unequal social status,</p>
      <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;left:500px;top: 3200px ">Women in India currently spend upto 352 minutes per day on domestic work, 577% more than men (52 minutes) and at least 40% more than women in South Africa and China 
        (the other two BRICS countries for which data are available), according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data.</p>
      <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;left:500px;top: 3300px ">If all the ladies doing their household chores for their family are paid for their job, then the amount paid to them would be equivalent to about 7.5 per cent of India's GDP, 
        according to State Bank of India's latest report. Whereas, a similar report released by International Labour Organisation said that 
        all the ladies of 64 countries across the world work for 1640 crore hours without any pay on a daily basis.</p>
      <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;left:500px;top: 3400px ">It important to comprehend the nature of the unpaid work done by the women to understand their status in the labour market. 
        It also carries immense importance in terms of calculating women's work participation rate in the economy.</p>
      <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;left:500px;top: 3500px ">SBI research has assumed a monthly income of ₹5,000 for rural women and ₹8,000 for urban women, which means they have taken it as the wage which these ladies would have received 
        had they worked for 8 hours in a day. There has also an additional assumption that 5% of these women in rural and 30% in urban areas are working for wages in the formal set-up.
         In its analysis, the report has indicated that "the total contribution of unpaid women to the economy is around ₹22.7 lakh crore (rural: ₹14.7 lakh crore and urban: ₹8.0 lakh crore) which is 
         almost 7.5 per cent of India’s GDP."</p>

  <h2>The need to address Pay Gap</h2>
    <p class="Paratext" style="position:absolute;padding-right:700px">The gender pay gap needs to be considered in
      the context of overall gender inequality. It is one
      of the more visible examples of structural gender
      discrimination stemming from the horizontal and
      vertical segmentation of labour forces. The greater
      participation of women in the labour market and their
      higher levels of education alone have proven to be
      insufficient to dismantle this segmentation.<p>
      <p class="Paratext"style="position:absolute;padding-right:700px;top:4160px">'How you structure your
         workforce is explicit, needs
to be architected and you
have to know which things to
do first. From our research
conducted a few years ago
on gender participation in
the workforce, we found that
across all economies that
increasing gender participation
adds a significant amount to
all economies. If we get the
big things right, like gender
participation, health and safety
standards, technology training
standards, we would make a lot
of progress.'

    <p class="Paratext" style="padding-left:500px;">The benefits of women earning the same as men include
      an increase in their purchasing power which in
      turn helps stimulate consumer spending and the economy.
      This is also the case with more contributions to
      pension schemes and spending of pension incomes.</p>
     
      <p class="Paratext" style="padding-left:500px;">Studies have linked
      increased labour participation rates of women with higher levels
      of GDP.
      The ways to reduce pay gap include:
      As a first step, recognition of the business benefits of improved gender diversity at all levels is
critical as well as commitment from top leadership. More specific approaches to narrowing the pay
gap include:
<p class="paratext" style="padding-left:500px;">• Promoting a gender-inclusive business culture while adopting a holistic approach to equal
remuneration for women and men for work of equal value.
• Making equitable salary offers to men and women.
• Basing pay on the position itself rather than previous pay of the employee as the latter
perpetuates the gender pay gap.
• Undertaking a gender pay review in the enterprise to assess whether there is a gender pay gap
and to what extent - conducting regular pay reviews can help a company keep on top of any
discrepancies.
• Making jobs more flexible so that more women access higher-level jobs and, therefore, higher pay.
• Ensuring that unconscious gender bias does not affect performance reviews.
• Selecting and applying a job evaluation methodology to assess the skills and responsibilities of
the various jobs in the enterprise with a view to adjust job titles, contents and corresponding
pay overtime.
• Sharing results with employer and business membership organizations and other companies in
the enterprise’s networks.</p>

<div class="challenges">
  <h2>Challenges in identifying the pay gap and Conclusion </h2>
  <p class="Paratext">The gender pay gap is a very complex and layered problem when it comes to solving or even analysing it. 
    All the factors mentioned above are one of the many layered problems that women face while facing the
   consequesnces of the pay gap. The partcipation of women in labor force may seem to go down which partially does impact the pay gap
   and contrubtion to the GDP,but the problem here lies when we see an a RISE IN GDP despite of women's lower
   participation. How does this happen?Women's work is seen as mostly a secondary source of income when it comes to a middle class household.Thebehavior <s>
   seen is women are expected to step out and work for the household in case of any financial emergency, and when things get
   better, go back to being the home-maker. This stops women from continuing their work to acheive higher paid positions, and thus
   impacts the total share of positions women have in management related and highly paid jobs.The reduced participation of women in the workforce is also a result of better educational opportunities, as the ages 15-24 years
   is the average age for enrolling in courses as well as getting employed.Better edcuational opportunities would mean more enrollment in education.
   Social factors like discrimination and gender bias are ingrained in the individuals since time immemorial and contibute to women's partcipation 
   in labor force pouplation greatly.
